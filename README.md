Objectives
----------

The main goals of E-Maj are:

 * log tables changes (Inserts, Updates, Deletes, Truncates) performed on one or several sets of tables;
 * efficiently cancel these changes if needed, and reset a tables set to a predefined stable state.

In development environments, it brings a good help in testing application, providing an easy way to rollback all updates generated by programs execution, and replay these processings as many times as needed.

In production environments, it brings a good solution to:

 * keep an history of changes performed on tables to examine them when needed;
 * set inter-batch savepoints on groups of tables;
 * easily "restore" this group of tables at a stable state, without being obliged to stop the cluster;
 * handle several savepoints during batch windows, each of them been usable at any time as "restore point".

It brings a good alternative to the management of several database disk images.

In both environments, being able to examine the history of changes performed on tables can be very helpful in debugging work or for any other purposes.
