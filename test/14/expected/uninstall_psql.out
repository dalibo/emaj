-- This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
--
-- This script uninstalls any E-Maj environment.
-- It drops all components previously created either by a "CREATE EXTENSION emaj;" statement or using a psql script.
--
-- When emaj is installed as an EXTENSION, the script must be executed by a role having SUPERUSER privileges.
-- Otherwise it must be executed by the emaj schema owner.
--
-- After its execution, some operations may have to be done manually.
